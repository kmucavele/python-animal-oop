# Object-Oriented Zoo


## Description
This project represents a virtual zoo, written in an object-oriented way.
The content is divided into various modules that cover animal abstractions, including definitions, types, enclosures, and the animals themselves.
It was created to explore and show some object-oriented programming strategies in Python, while coming from a Java background.
Especially, how encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism can be implemented in Python.


Interesting Concepts used in this project:
* Multiple inheritance, which is non-existing in most programming languages:
  * with Abstract Base Class (ABC classes)
* Method Decorators for properties and abstract methods:
  * `@foo_setter.setter` or `@abstractmethod`
* Dunder Methods or Magic Method for human-readable object representation: 
  * `def __repr__()`

Entry point of the project is [Zoo.py](Zoo.py) and has some example code.
The project was made in the second year of my apprenticeship and is based on a Java Assignment.

## Usage
Simply clone this repository run [Zoo.py](Zoo.py) or/and feel free to experiment with the other classes.

### Prerequisites
* Python 3 or higher is recommended. (The project only uses built-in libraries)
